### Statistical Softwares

In this course you will need to use the statistical software package R and there are three options for you.

1. Install R and RStudio on your own computer.
2. Use Posit Cloud.
3. Use the COSAM Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD).

I suggest that you go with option 1 (links are provided here [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/**Links to an external site.**](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). Please note that you need to install R first and then RStudio.

If you don't want to or cannot install any software on your computer then go with option 2 or 3. Option 2 is very convenient but you need an internet connection and you may have to pay some money. Using the Posit Cloud is free for casual use (less than 25 hours per month). For more usage time you need to pay \$5 monthly for up to 75 hours per month. If you need even more time it will cost you 10 cents for each additional hour. Here are the steps for option 3:

1. Use the short URL address of [https://aub.ie/cosamwvd**Links to an external site.**](https://aub.ie/cosamwvd)
2. At the Microsoft Login Screen, use your [username@auburn.edu](mailto:username@auburn.edu), not your email alias.
3. At the Auburn Login Screen, use your Auburn Password
4. You may be sent a Duo Multifactor Authentication either by Push, Text, or Phone Call

The advantage of option 1 is speed. Also, this approach is more convenient once it is set up correctly.

R and RStudio run on a server in option 3 at the university and you are using your computer or tablet as a terminal. This approach is slower because input and output has to travel between your computer and the university server. The whole process is also slowed down by the fact that it is run in the browser rather than in some dedicated and optimized software.
